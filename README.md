Datasets used to inform decision-making in the health sector
 
Analysis of these datasets has direct influence on decisions affecting the health outcomes of both individuals and entire populations. For that reason, it is imperative that the data be accurate, faithful, secure, private, and transparent, regardless of its source or any intervening transformations. In fact, those transformations need to be well documented and undoable.

Given the importance of the decisions it informs, it is entirely conceivable that the data chain will be subject to scrutiny after the fact - either academic or legal - and should be maintained in a manner that will permit such scrutiny.

In tension with that mandate, the nature of exploratory research is inherently chaotic. Processes are in a constant state of flux, data formats and structures are malleable, mistakes are made, decisions are taken, reversed, retaken, abandoned, etc. And yet, through this ever-shifting landscape, we must still somehow track what gets modified, and why, for every piece of data that contributes to the overall findings.

Two concerns to address: 

	- How to demonstrate an unbroken chain of verifications from raw data creation through to the final publication of derived datasets
	- How to document all intentional changes to the data
	- How to detect unintentional changes so they can be corrected
